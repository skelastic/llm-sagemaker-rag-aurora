## Run the Streamlit application in Studio

SageMaker Studio provides a convenient platform to host the Streamlit web application. The following steps describes how to run the Streamlit app on SageMaker Studio.

1. Open Studio and then open a new **System terminal**.
2. Run the following commands on the terminal to clone the code repository and install the Python packages needed by the application:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/skelastic/llm-sagemaker-rag-aurora.git
   cd llm-sagemaker-rag-aurora/app
   python -m venv .env
   source .env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. In the shell, set the following environment variables with the values that are available from the CloudFormation stack output.
   ```
   export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   export PGVECTOR_SECRET_ID="INSERT_DB_SECRET_ID"
   export COLLECTION_NAME="INSERT_COLLECTION_NAME"
   export EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT_NAME="INSERT_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT_NAME"
   export TEXT2TEXT_ENDPOINT_NAME="INSERT_TEXT2TEXT_ENDPOINT_NAME"
   ```
4. When the application runs successfully, youâ€™ll see an output similar to the following (the IP addresses you will see will be different from the ones shown in this example). Note the port number (typically `8501`) from the output to use as part of the URL for app in the next step.
   ```
   sagemaker-user@studio$ streamlit run app.py

   Collecting usage statistics. To deactivate, set browser.gatherUsageStats to False.

   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

   Network URL: http://169.255.255.2:8501
   External URL: http://52.4.240.77:8501
   ```
5. You can access the app in a new browser tab using a URL that is similar to your Studio domain URL. For example, if your Studio URL is `https://d-randomidentifier.studio.us-west-2.sagemaker.aws/jupyter/default/lab?` then the URL for your Streamlit app will be `https://d-randomidentifier.studio.us-west-2.sagemaker.aws/jupyter/default/proxy/8501/app` (notice that `lab` is replaced with `proxy/8501/app`). If the port number noted in the previous step is different from `8501` then use that instead of `8501` in the URL for the Streamlit app.
